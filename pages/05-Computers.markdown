I have a few computers that I use on a regular basis. I use some computers more than others, and some activities are only ever performed on a certain computer (e.g. audio editing on my Mac mini).

I try to keep them in sync with each other too. For example, I keep a single [vimrc file][] in [a repository on GitHub][GitHub steinhardt/vimrc] which each of my computers "subscribes" to. When I make changes to my vimrc, I push the revised file up to GitHub and my other computers download the new version without manual intervention.


# Apple iMac `MAHLIKA`

Pronounced *mah-hill-kah*. `MAHLIKA` is the name of my 27-inch [Apple iMac][]. She is what I use for writing, coding and video conferencing with friends. She took over from my 2008 Mac mini (see below) as my primary home computer shortly after I bought her in 2012.

**Manufacturer**: Apple.
**Make and model**: iMac (27 inch, mid-2011).
**Operating system**: Mac OS X 10.8 "Mountain Lion".
**Year of manufacturer**: 2012.
**Clock rate (processor "speed")**: 2,7 GHz.
**HDD/SDD capacity**: 1 TB.


# Apple Mac mini

My Mac mini has been my computing companion since December 2008 and has remained faithful to me to this day. He is my current "media centre" (I *do* hate that phrase) and holds my many, many [Phish][] albums. He doesn't have a name name and I don't think it would appropriate to give him one any time soon, as he's due to be given to my parents (who desperately need a Mac of some variety) by the end of the year.

**Manufacturer**: Apple.
**Make and model**: Mac mini (Mid 2007).
**Operating system**: Mac OS X 10.5 "Leopard".
**Year of manufacturer**: 2008.
**Clock rate (processor "speed")**: 2,0 GHz.
**HDD/SDD capacity**: 120 GB.


# Dell Inspiron mini 10

My super nimble SSD netbook goes almost everywhere with me and, even though it's configured with a QWERTY keyboard, I use it for writing all manner of things; and it was my primary non-audio computer when I was studying radio at Cambridge Regional College. I haven't converted it to [Dvorak][Dvorak Simplified Keyboard] (with [these awesome little stickers][Dvorak stickers]) yet because I feel that it's near the end of its operational lifespan, but I will sticker my next netbook. Like my Mac mini (see above), my netbook doesn't have a *name* name of its own.

**Manufacturer**: Dell.
**Make and model**: Inspiron mini 10.
**Operating system**: Ubuntu 10.04 "Lucid Lynx".
**Year of manufacturer**: unknown. <!-- FIXME -->
**Clock rate (processor "speed")**: 1,6 GHz.
**HDD/SDD capacity**: 28 GB.


# IBM xSeries 225 `DOLAP`

I got given `DOLAP` by a friend in early 2012. He's *awfully* loud (~70 dB when idle) so I don't use him that often, only really for testing purposes. I tried to shut him up a little with [pwmconfig][] but I wasn't successful in configuring [fancontrol][].

**Manufacturer**: IBM.
**Make and model**: xSeries 225.
**Operating system**: Debian 6.0 "Squeeze".
**Year of manufacturer**: unknown. <!-- FIXME -->
**Clock rate (processor "speed")**: unknown. <!-- FIXME -->
**HDD/SDD capacity**: unknown. <!-- FIXME GB (4x FIXME GB) -->

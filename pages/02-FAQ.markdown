# Who are you and why did you bring me here?

My name is Kevin Steinhardt. I'm a graphic designer and ex-radio broadcast journalist from Cambridge in the United Kingdom. I studied design and then radio journalism at [Cambridge Regional College][CRC], before moving to the Netherlands in 2011.

At the moment, I work as one of two designers on staff at the fetish wholesale company [Mister B][] {{nsfw}}. I've previously worked at the Dutch international radio station [RNW][] too. You can find my professional "profile" on [LinkedIn][].

# What's the reason behind kevinsteinhardt.net?

I've had a website for a good few years now. On moving to the Netherlands and with my previous site wilting from neglect, I thought it best that started from scratch and wrote a new site - to be both a portfolio of the many projects I was working on at the time, and also as a place to direct people to in times of need (needing my contact details, for example).

This site was originally intended to be but a *one*-page affair. But, as the (then) single page grew and grew, it wasn't exactly getting any easier to manage. The [Projects](./01-projects) page you see today formed the *main* bulk of that single document. 

There *used* to be both an 'About' and a 'Kevin' page - the latter of which was more biographical and personal. They both seemed to overlap each other though, so I decided to merge them into *this* FAQ.


# How did you come to be in the Netherlands?

I've written a blog post answering this question before - you can find the post [here][blogpost]. I wanted to experience the *far superior* cycle infrastructure in the Netherlands, and managed to secure an internship at a Dutch radio station through my radio journalism course at college. I secured a full-time job (though not in radio) and ended up moving over from the UK.

# What technical experience do you have?

Well I've been a Mac and Linux user since 2005, which has to count towards something. I'm learning [Perl][] and [XLST][] at the moment and I've been using HTML/CSS for years now (though you can't really compare Perl and HTML *in any case*). On the audio side of things, I've had experience with [Dalet][] (what a terrible few months *that* was) and editors like Adobe Audition. I use the enterprise management software [Exact Globe][] like nobody's business at work too.

<!-- # Can you actually speak Dutch?

Natuurlijk.  FIXME TRANSLATE BELOW:
Of course! Brits don't have a good reputation for learning other languages, so to find a Englishman that *actually* speak two languages is a little weird. But I live in the Netherlands and I plan on staying here, so I might as well learn Dutch. It's no more difficult than English. -->


# Your website looks pretty simple.

That's not *actually* a question. This site looks pretty simple because I wanted a clean, minimalistic design. The backend isn't super complicated either; but I write each "page" as a [Markdown][] document which gets transmogrificated into HTML when you click one of the tabs. Also, the tabs themselves are generated from the file names of the Markdown documents. This is made possible with some PHP and, of course, the help of my good friend [Stephen Radford][Stephen].

<!-- this is always the LAST question! -->
# I want to know more / I have a question which isn't in the FAQ.

Again, that's not actually a question; *neither is*. But if you come with me to [Formspring][], you can ask me anything you'd like there. If I like your question enough, I'll write a *proper* Steinhardtian response and include it in this FAQ.

If you don't want to use Formspring, send me a [tweet][Twitter] via Twitter or email me at <kevinsteinhardt@gmail.com>!

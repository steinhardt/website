# Who are you and why did you bring me here?

My name is Kevin Steinhardt. I'm a graphic designer and ex-radio broadcast journalist from Cambridge in the United Kingdom. I studied design and then radio journalism at [Cambridge Regional College][CRC], before moving to the Netherlands in 2011.

At the moment, I work as one of two designers on staff at the fetish wholesale company [Mister B][] {{nsfw}}. I've previously worked at the Dutch international radio station [RNW][] too. You can find my professional "profile" on [LinkedIn][].

# What's the reason behind kevinsteinhardt.net?

I've had a website for a good few years now. On moving to the Netherlands and with my previous site wilting from neglect, I thought it best that started from scratch and wrote a new site - to be both a portfolio of the many projects I was working on at the time, and also as a place to direct people to in times of need (needing my contact details, for example).

This site was originally intended to be but a *one*-page affair. But, as the (then) single page grew and grew, it wasn't exactly getting any easier to manage. The [Projects](./01-projects) page you see today formed the *main* bulk of that single document. 

There *used* to be both an 'About' and a 'Kevin' page - the latter of which was more biographical and personal. They both seemed to overlap each other though, so I decided to merge them into *this* FAQ.


# How did you come to be in the Netherlands?

I've written [a blog post][How I ended up here] answering this question before, which is more detailed than the summary I've written for this site.

I was studying radio at [Cambridge Regional College][CRC] and, being an avid cyclist, I wanted to experience the *far superior* cycle infrastructure in the Netherlands; Cambridge may be the cycling capital of the UK but it's far from perfect. Through my course, I managed to secure an internship at the Dutch international service [RNW][] (which has sadly been pretty much closed down since). My bike broke during the second or third week, and I ended up leaving it in the Netherlands which gave me a reason to go back a week later. Then things get complicated so head over to [this post][How I ended up here] to find out what happened next.

# What technical experience do you have?

Well I've been a Mac and Linux user since 2005, which has to count towards something. I'm learning [Perl][] and [XLST][] at the moment and I've been using HTML/CSS for years now (though you can't really compare Perl and HTML *in any case*). On the audio side of things, I've had experience with [Dalet][] (what a terrible few months *that* was) and editors like Adobe Audition. I use the enterprise management software [Exact Globe][] like nobody's business at work too.

# Can you actually speak Dutch?

Yes.


# Your website looks pretty simple.

That's not *actually* a question. This site looks pretty simple because it *is* but also because I wanted a clean, minimalistic design. The backend, however, is what I'm more interested in. Every public page is kept in a Git repository on my computers which is "pushed" to the social coding website [Github][] when edited. My server automatically pulls the content down, which is then made available for the public to read.

The pages themselves are written in a markup language called [Markdown][]. These documents (which are basically plain text with a few symbols added for things like *emphasis* and **bold** type, as well as the ability to link) are then translated into the HTML markup language when someone opens a page. *Even* the tabs along the top are automatically generated from the contents of the `pages/` directory.

I'd like to (again) thank my good friend [Stephen Radford][] for helping me out with the code&iuml;ng of this site.

<!-- this is always the LAST question! -->
# I want to know more / I have a question which isn't in the FAQ.

Again, that's not actually a question; *neither is*. But if you come with me to [Formspring][], you can ask me anything you'd like there. If I like your question enough, I'll write a *proper* Steinhardtian response and include it in this FAQ.

If you don't want to use Formspring, send me a [tweet][Twitter] via Twitter or email me at <kevinsteinhardt@gmail.com>!

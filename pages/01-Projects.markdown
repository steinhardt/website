My name is Kevin Steinhardt. I'm a graphic designer and ex-radio broadcast journalist from Cambridge in the United Kingdom. I studied design and radio broadcasting before moving here to the Netherlands in 2011. I work as one of two graphic designers at the fetish wholesale company [Mister B][] {{nsfw}}.

This site is both a portfolio of my recent projects and a place to find more information about me and what I get up to. My online presence varies, but you can find me or my works on one of the following: [Daytum][], [Facebook][], [Flickr][], [GitHub][], [Google Plus][], [LinkedIn][], [Pinboard][], [Soundcloud][], [Spotify][], [Tumblr][] and [Twitter][].


Current projects
================

I'm working on a lot at the moment but I don't think of anything that I'm working on as a traditional "project". For me, a project is something like a graphic commission or a podcast (both of which I've done in the past; see below). 

*Re*learning to touch type, only this time on a [Dvorak keyboard][Dvorak], is another ongoing project of mine. I can't remember what attracted me to the Dvorak layout but *it's certainly geeky* and it's also amusing to watch people struggle to use my computers - *hands off*! I'm progressing quite well with this - but with both my work and home keyboards "converted" (and, as a matter of fact, identical keyboard models), I have noticed a huge speed difference at home: typing at home is actually *slower*, though I think this is down to different desk arrangements more than anything else.

## Learning Dutch

<span class="tag">status</span><span class="tag-right" style="background-color: green;">ongoing</span>

And, although they're not really *projects* per se, I'm learning both [Dutch][] and [Perl][] - one, an illogical language known *well* only to the highest of scholars; and Perl. I plan on applying for Dutch citizenship *as soon as I can* and that's motivating me to [read and annotate newspapers][Learning Dutch with newspapers], watch television with the subtitles on, listen to the radio on the train to work and so on. The motivation behind learning *Perl* was that I was looking for a more powerful alternative to [bash scripting][]. <!-- FIXME split this up and put Perl-related things in the Perl section just below -->

<a href="http://ksteinhardt.wordpress.com"><img class="thumb-right" src="images/projects/ksteinhardt.jpg" /></a> My only *real* project at the moment, aside from this website, is my blog [K Steinhardt][My blog] though I haven't been keeping up with my "more than one post per week" target as of late. I like writing (especially if it's only for me to read later)<!-- FIXME better way of saying this? --> and I like writing about a diverse range of subjects - not just subjects I know a lot about. For those subjects I'm *less* comfortable with, I do a little research before writing a post; I like to see this as a chance for me to learn something new that I wouldn't have learnt before.


## Experimental photography

<span class="tag">status</span><span class="tag-right" style="background-color: orange;">on hold</span>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinsteinhardt"><img class="thumb-left" src="images/projects/photography.jpg" /></a> Since moving to the Netherlands, I've been taking fewer and fewer photographs *for leisure* but photography is none-the-less a great passion of mine. I'm *far* from being a professional photographer, but I studied photography at college for two years and both my sisters and my father are keen photographers too. I'd like to get back into doing more experimental photography, such as [infrared][], but I don't think this would be practical where I live at the moment.


Projects on the back burner
===========================

I can't always keep up with the projects I start - *I'm only human* after all. I do occasionally postpone projects indefinitely, for a more suitable occasion.

Just before I came to the Netherlands, I started writing the format documents for a travel writing expedition around the world. The list of places I'd end up visiting formed part of a larger list of articles complied using [Wikipedia's random article shortcut][Random Wikipedia]. The working title of this project is Withsel - from "<u>With</u> a <u>sel</u>ection from Wikipedia".
<!-- FIXME Is "shortcut" a good word?! -->

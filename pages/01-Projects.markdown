My name is Kevin Steinhardt. I'm a graphic designer and ex-radio broadcast journalist from Cambridge in the United Kingdom. I studied design and radio broadcasting before moving here to the Netherlands in 2011. I work as one of two graphic designers at the fetish wholesale company [Mister B][] {{nsfw}}.

This site is both a portfolio of my recent projects and a place to find more information about me and what I get up to. My online presence varies, but you can find me or my works on one of the following: [Daytum][], [Facebook][], [Flickr][], [GitHub][], [Google Plus][], [LinkedIn][], [Pinboard][], [Soundcloud][], [Spotify][], [Tumblr][] and [Twitter][].


Current projects
================

I'm working on a lot at the moment but I don't think of anything that I'm working on as a traditional "project". For me, a project is something like a graphic commission or a podcast (both of which I've done in the past; see below). 

*Re*learning to touch type, only this time on a [Dvorak keyboard][Dvorak], is another ongoing project of mine. I can't remember what attracted me to the Dvorak layout but *it's certainly geeky* and it's also amusing to watch people struggle to use my computers - *hands off*! I'm progressing quite well with this - but with both my work and home keyboards "converted" (and, as a matter of fact, identical keyboard models), I have noticed a huge speed difference at home: typing at home is actually *slower*, though I think this is down to different desk arrangements more than anything else.

## National Diploma Radio coursework

## Digitisation

## Learning Dutch

<span class="tag">status</span><span class="tag-right" style="background-color: green;">ongoing</span>

I plan on applying for Dutch citizenship in the near future, which is motivating me to [read and annotate newspapers][Learning Dutch with newspapers], watch television with the subtitles on, and listen to the radio on the train to work; to learn as much Dutch as I can. 


## Learning Perl

<span class="tag">status</span><span class="tag-right" style="background-color: green;">ongoing</span>

The main motivation behind learning Perl was that I was looking for a more powerful alternative to [bash scripting][]. Following the UNIX philosophy "do one thing and do it well", I plan on writing short but powerful scripts; something Bash *could* do but it lacked features like text processing.


## K Steinhardt

<span class="tag">status</span><span class="tag-right" style="background-color: green;">ongoing</span>

<a href="http://ksteinhardt.wordpress.com"><img class="thumb-right" src="images/projects/ksteinhardt.jpg" /></a> My biggest writing project at the moment in terms of content *actually published* would have to be my (barely updated) shambles of a blog, [K Steinhardt][My blog]. I haven't been keeping up with my "more than one post per week" token target as of late, but it's not that I don't *want* to write - I *love* to write. I especially like to write about like to subjects I'm not so knowledge&auml;ble in; the research I do before such posts I like to see as a chance to learn something new that I wouldn't have considered learning before.


## kevinsteinhardt.net

<span class="tag">status</span><span class="tag-right" style="background-color: green;">ongoing</span>

Then, of course, there's *this* project: kevinsteinhardt.net. I wanted to give my love of [Markdown][] somewhere to develop and fester; so I asked my friend [Stephen Radford][] to help me rejuvenate one of my old simplistic site designs into something fresh and Markdown-based.

I explain briefly how the site works *behind the scenes* on the [FAQ page](./02-faq).


## Experimental photography

<span class="tag">status</span><span class="tag-right" style="background-color: orange;">on hold</span>

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/kevinsteinhardt"><img class="thumb-left" src="images/projects/photography.jpg" /></a> Since moving to the Netherlands, I've been taking fewer and fewer photographs *for leisure* but photography is none-the-less a great passion of mine. I'm *far* from being a professional photographer, but I studied photography at college for two years and both my sisters and my father are keen photographers too. I'd like to get back into doing more experimental photography, such as [infrared][], but I don't think this would be practical where I live at the moment.


Projects on the back burner
===========================

I can't always keep up with the projects I start - *I'm only human* after all. I do occasionally postpone projects indefinitely, for a more suitable occasion.

Just before I came to the Netherlands, I started writing the format documents for a travel writing expedition around the world. The list of places I'd end up visiting formed part of a larger list of articles complied using [Wikipedia's random article shortcut][Random Wikipedia]. The working title of this project is Withsel - from "<u>With</u> a <u>sel</u>ection from Wikipedia".
<!-- FIXME Is "shortcut" a good word?! -->


Past projects
